IoT based weather monitoring system using Raspberry PI

Many things that affect the weather conditions of a place it can have an adverse effect on most of the environment. At a weather study of different parameters using instruments and equipmentâ€™s has been done. Sensors are necessary components that can be used for measuring traffic flow, weather parameters such as humidity, temperature, pressure etc. which are used for predicting the environmental conditions. So, to meet the goal of weather monitoring we have designed IoT based real-time, low-cost, portable and high-speed weather station using Raspberry Pi. 
IoT provides interconnection of physical devices, vehicles and other components like sensors. Network connectivity allows the systems that are embedded with electronic devices, software, and sensors.  Using Internet of things, parameters are sensed remotely over the connected network. 
In our project a weather monitoring system website was developed was with Raspberry Pi webserver. A weather monitoring system based on embedded and web technology was implemented. The system is designed with the use of various hardware tools like raspberry pi, DHT22 sensor and software tools like python with flask framework. The data was stored into a sqlite3 database which contained the information on various parameters like temperature, humidity etc. 

In this project we predict the conditions in a region based on the values of weather parameters such as humidity, temperature. The raspberry pi sensor modules that can be installed in different parts of the world and the weather conditions of that place can be accessed through the server where the data from the sensors is transmitted and stored. This system monitors temperature, humidity. The flowchart describes our system that we modeled.
